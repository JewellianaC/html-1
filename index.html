 <h1>Environmental Stuggles with Littering</h1>  
 <h3>What is The Problem?</h3>
 <p>Littering is a modern day porblem, however, many people are still unaware as to what it is. Littering includes all items that are not disposed of properly, and are instead thrown randomly or carlessly onto the ground, or into the ocean. This causes many issues with the Environment because now the littered items are now in the homes and natural habitats of animals, plants, and other species. These littered items can be extremely dangerous to these to all the creatures, plants, and species in addition to becoming the cause of their death.</p>
<p>There are multiple different types and examples of what gets littered, here are some of the most common found trash:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cigarette butts </li>
<li>Soda Cans</li>
<li>Plastic bags</li>
<li>Water bottles</li>
<li>Fishing Tackle</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a few examples, keep in mind that there are thousands to millions of different kinds of trash and food being thrown out where they should not be.</p>
<h3>Why is Fixing This Problem Important?</h3>
When looking at the problems that littering seems to cause in the Environment, you also have to look at that times a couple billion. The reason for that is, there is not just one person who litters, there are millions to billions of people everyday that litter. It has been said that every person has at least littered once in their whole lilfetime, this could be considered the proof on how the ocean has come to house over three trillion tons of straight up garbage. Even though most have figured out just how bad littering has come in the present day, it still seem to not show signs of slowing down. If people keep continuing to litter then the world is not going to last much longer. 
<h3>How Could We Fix This Problem?</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways others could step up, and finally come close to ending the Environmental Struggles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Local businesses could stop using plastic bags, and instead have customers buy/bring their own bags from home to keep, and carry their groceries in.</li>
<li>There could be more garbage and recycle bins in more local, and hard to get areas, so instead of people having to hold there trash until a bin happens to pop up, there could be a bin near by that they could use.</li>
<li>Educate the younger children about what to do, and what not to do, so the future generations know how to keep the world a better and healthier place.</li>
<li>Spread the word about littering, why it is harmful, as well as why we need to work on stopping it, and how.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are only a few ways for us--as a society--to be able to stop littering and focus on helping the Environment. If we focus on these four steps together, the struggles and challenges the Environment is going through could be stopped, and then we could help the Environment grow into something better. </p>
